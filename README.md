### Instructions to visualize API data in an interface

1. **Create a New Virtual Environment**  
   Open your terminal and create a virtual environment by running:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .env
   ```

2. **Activate Your Environment**  
   Depending on your operating system, use the appropriate command to activate the environment:

   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **MacOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**  
   With the environment activated, install the necessary libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Unzip the Data File**  
   Locate the data file in **Devo Drive/Meryam** and unzip it. Move the extracted files into your project directory, or to a specific directory if the code requires it.

5. **Add the Data File to Your Code**  
   Ensure that the data file path in the code points to the location where you placed the data file. Update the path if necessary.

6. **Run the Code**  
   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
