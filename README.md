### Instructions to visualize API data in an interface

1. **Create a New Virtual Environment**  
   Open your terminal and create a virtual environment by running:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .env
   ```

2. **Activate Your Environment**  
   Depending on your operating system, use the appropriate command to activate the environment:

   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **MacOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**  
   With the environment activated, install the necessary libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Unzip the Data File**  
   Locate the data file in **Devo Drive/Meryam** and download it to your local machine. **Important:** Do not unzip it directly in the Drive! Extract the contents and place     the unzipped data folder in the same directory as `app.py`.

5. **Run the Code**  
   Start the application by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Access the Application**  
   After running the application, a link will be displayed in the terminal. Open this link in your browser to access the application.
